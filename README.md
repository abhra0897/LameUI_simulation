## LameUI Simulator

This is the OPenGL based simulator for [LameUI](https://github.com/abhra0897/LameUI).

Use this simulator to rapidly test LameUI before deploying to microcontroller. Use the example codes as template and modify as needed. OPenGL based functions should NOT be modified.

Proper template and tutorial for this simulator will be added soon.
